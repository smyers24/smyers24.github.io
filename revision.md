History log
-------

8/5/19: Repo initially created. Awaiting DNS propogation before really diving in. Planning on getting more familiar with GitHub in the upcoming days. Likely that little actual development work will happen until HTTPS is figured out 
  - I'm planning on using Jekyll as the basis for my design. As such, I'll be looking through https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll and making inquiries based on what I find there
  - I hope that within a week or so I can have one or two interesting pages written 

8/6/19
  GOALS:
    - Add a new page for resume [DONE]
    - Add an 'about me' page [DONE]
  
  STATUS:
  - Still seeing redirect issue. Was hoping it's resolved - not sure if this is user error or DNS proprogation time, as previously mentioned
  - Additional difficulties come in the form of working on a business laptop without admin priveleges. 
  - Ruby, Gems, and Jekyll have successfully been installed
  - Sample Jekyll blog up and running (following https://jekyllrb.com/docs/)
  - Main repository now reflects sample blog
  -

  LESSONS LEARNED:
   - Should have forked jekyll instead of downloading + copying. 
   - Use local editing more + commit less. This was really just a symptom of the setup. I already understand this from SVN
