## Introduction 
Hello!


My name is Scott Myers and I am a Software Engineer.
I have extensive experience with programming in a variety of languages. At the moment I am most comfortable with C#, but I'm always working on expanding my skillset.
My degree is in Electrical Engineering, but the majority of my professional career has been focused on coding. Between my professional work and my self-taught experiences, I can be an asset to any team.

When I'm not coding, learning, or messing with circuits, you can usually find me in the kitchen testing new recipes and tasting new ingredients. Outside of engineering, I'm a very passionate home chef and I absolutely love cooking. I've also played video games for my entire life, which has spawned some really interesting projects. Check them out on my [GitHub Page](https://github.com/smyers24?tab=repositories) .

Want to talk? Feel free to reach out to me! I'm always interested in hearing new ideas, starting new collaborations, and getting feedback.

My programming experience overview can be seen below:

## Programming Skills

#### C#: controls, communications, and data processing
- Lead developer for code development and refactoring.
	- Modernize code library and ensure all code is modular
	- Process feedback data from systems and manipulate using algorithms, file IO, and more. 
	- Help oversee direction of code progression
	- Delegate tasks to interns to ensure deadlines are met
- Develop serial communication software to talk to hardware devices

#### Python: Basic projects
  - Several Raspberry Pi projects such as: Spotify server, Minecraft server, basic LED control, and more.
  - 'Traditional' projects include [a basic change machine](https://github.com/smyers24/Change-Machine.git) or [a text to NATO phonetic alphabet translator](https://github.com/smyers24/Text-to-NATO-Phonetic-Alphabet.git)
  - Working on stats analyzing program and web crawler that generates word clouds.
  
#### Verilog: FPGAs - both simulations and on hardware
- Interfacing between ethernet and dma protocols to manage data in a complex FPGA system.
- Improve and optimize low-latency systems  
  
#### LabVIEW: Many automation based projects
- Complex automation program utilizing Digilent Waveforms SDK, SCPI commands, data processing, and file IO. 
	- Purpose is to reduce labor hours spent on repetitive tasks. Runs test, processes data, and saves for later examination.
	- Cut down test time by over 400%. Still in regular use.
	- Entirely self-lead.
  
#### MATLAB/Octave : Data-processing algorithms
- Find and isolate problematic patterns in a system. Take massive data sets and evaluate for abnormalities.
	- Successfully located issue and lead to the resolution of a critical and longstanding bug. 
- Complex algorithm solving
 
#### C++: Self-taught basics
- Basic knowledge of syntax and fundamentals. Implemented several math algorithms.
  
#### BGScript: Blueooth 
- Establish psuedo-serial communication over Blueooth protocols between microcontroller and computer. 
   
- Basic knowledge of syntax and fundamentals. Primary applications have been microcontrollers.
