## Introduction 
Hello!


My name is Scott Myers and I am an aspiring Software Engineer. My current title is Electronics Engineer I, but my primary job function is coding. I have taken a few classes that directly teach coding, but most of what I have learned has been self-taught. Over the course of my college career I've learned a new skill or language each year due to changing interests and developing requirements at work. I think some of my greatest attributes are my ability to quickly learn new things and my tenacity in working through challenges. This has often enabled me to hop from project-to-project as needed and make quickly make meaningful contributions to my teams

My programming experience overview can be seen below:

## Programming Skills

#### Verilog: FPGAs - both simulations and on hardware
  - I learned Verilog initially in school and then further developed my skills at work. Writing test benches, debugging code, and writing code for state machines. This has been the bulk of my recent coding knowledge at work.

#### C#: Control program utilizing serial communication and Bluetooth protocol. 
  - I was tasked with writing a C# GUI that used the aforementioned protocols. I had no prior C# experience but managed to develop a program in          3 days which was used for the rest of the contract. It controlled motor speeds, did signal processing, and managed all of the communications for the program. I have since written other serial communication GUI's using a similar framework.
  
#### LabVIEW: Many automation based projects
  - I have a large amount of experience with LabVIEW. Some may not consider grpahical programming to be "real" programming, but it absolutely teaches algorithms and thinking with code.
  - My most ambitious LabVIEW program was an automation program that I made for my internship with Solid State Ceramics. It utilized the Digilent Waveforms SDK as well as SCPI commands to completely automate a testing procedure. This program took about 10 months to complete and was entirely done through my own resarch and hard work. It sent our information, captured information, processes, and writes to a file. It has immensely increase manufacturing capabilities and is still in use today.
  - A program that I'm most proud of is a temperature control module. Using a hysteretic control loop, it regulated the temperature in an environmental chamber to make sure that a device can reach and hold the desired temperature. It has closed loop feedback using the chamber's control module as well as a thermocouple for accurate measurements.
  - My first few projects were in school where I initially got my NI CLAD certification. This has since expired, but I'm confident that I could get re-certified if I took the test again. I made an optical theremin with auto-tune, a few state machines, and some basic processing programs.
  
#### MATLAB/Octave : School and self-taught processing algorithms
  - I've always found the basic scripting language of MATLAB/Octave to be so enjoyable. It's basic and to-the-point. The syntax makes sense and it's incredibly powerful. We learned MATLAB in a few classes in school, mostly being processing algorithms. It frequently involved tediously solving a math problem by hand and then quickly doing it in MATLAB. 
  - I learned Octave due to necessity at work. It turns out that MATLAB is *very* expensive, so Octave is a great alternative. I wrote a program that processes the output data of some hardware that was experiencing glitches. There was a ton of data to sift through and it was difficult to locate errors/glitches by just looking for them. So I wrote a script that automatically parsed through the data, found glitches, and put a red 'o' around them to denote that an error was there. Additionally, I added debugging info and plotted it all. This made it easy to locate consistent faults in the hardware and eventually work on fixes. 
 
 #### C++: Self-taught basics
  - I have a basic level of C++ knowledge. Most of this was acquired for personal satisfaction. I learned most of the C++ that I know from HackerRank and books. I have written a few basic programs and algorithms.
  
#### Python: Self-taught using a Raspberry Pi
  - I wanted to learn Python because I've heard so much about its overall utility. I also have a Raspberry Pi that I occasionally use for a fun personal project. My favorites have been hosting a Spotify server and powering some LEDs using buttons. Admittedly, much of this was based off work that I saw online. However, I have a new personal project that I've been brainstorming up using Python. Hopefully I'll be able to start that soon and upload my code to my GitHub page.
  
  #### BGScript: A dreadful Blueooth language
   - A proprietary Bluetooth language. It was tough to use it and follow some of the documentation, but it was interesting to learn and satisfying to conquer. 
   
   #### C: Basic microcontrollers in school
   - My C experience is limited, primarily being focused around microcontrollers. These were mostly state machines in school.
